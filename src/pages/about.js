      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hello World,</p>
      <p>I'm Jason Tuyen and I often go by the alias of iCookieStalker. If you're reading this, thanks for visiting my website!</p>
      <p>
        I am currently studying Computer Science and Education (specialization in Equity and Engagement) in California.
        My overall goal is to pursue a career in Software Engineering and to build products that helps others. 
        My biggest values are accessibility and simplicity which is why I enjoyed my previous work
        as a Special Education Tutor and IT Tech Support.

        Outside of technolgy and coding I enjoy playing video games, rocking out on my drums, and binging anime + k-dramas.
        My other interests include making music playlists, editing videos, and searching for the best cookie. 
        I've also picked up new hobbies during the COVID-19 pandemic such as longboard dancing and photography.

        My two favorite accomplishments are when I won a rap competition and when I helped edit a short film. But accomplishments are better
        as a team so if you want to collab feel free to send me a message form any of the links below.

      <p><b>Good Luck Have Fun,<br></br>Jason "iCookieStalker" Tuyen</b></p>
