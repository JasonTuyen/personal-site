ChatGPT and Artifical Inteligence has been making headlines, so I decided to create my own virtual assistant.


[GitHub Coming Soon](/posts/virtual-ai-asst.md)


## Project Summary
This is an on-going project that I have been working on in-between jobs. 
With how quick AI is growing a lot of what I am building now might become obsolete real quick.
Anyways, this AI assistant is built with Python and OpenAI and will have functions similar to Apple's Siri.


## Project Requirements
* Access local weather and traffic info
* Assist with email response and creation
* Answer questions
* Automate tasks such as: playlist suggestions, turning on lights, etc.
