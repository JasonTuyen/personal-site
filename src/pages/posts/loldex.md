## Project Summary
Inspired by a recent Pokedex react project, I decided to make my own based on League of Legends. 
Using React and the Riot Games API, I was able to fetch and display each League of Legends champion and their details. 


## Project Requirements
* Interact with the Riot Games API
* Retrieve every Champion and its key information


## Project Thoughts
This was just a quick little inspired project that I built in a few spare hours of my time. 
Therefore the coding for this project was simple and straightforward. 
I already had experience using React to make API calls. 
So most of my time was just spent reading the documentation to understand what Riot Games sends with their API. 
In the future, I do want to expand on this project by adding a voting option to see what everyoneâ€™s favorite champion is.
