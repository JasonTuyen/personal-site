A random team generator for Fire Emblem Three Houses.


[GitHub Repo Link](https://github.com/JasonTuyen/RandomFE3H)


## Project Summary
A random team generator for the Fire Emblem Three Houses Game. 
Built using Python and potentially tkinter for the GUI.
Running this program will return you a team for your next playthough of Fire Emblem Three Houses. 
I created this program because I was getting bored of running "optimal" playthroughs of Three Houses and to practice my Python.


## Project Requirements
* Randomly generates characters and classes for a Fire Emblem Three Houses playthrough
* Should accept user input for type of playthrough


## Project Thoughts
This project was a small little summer project. 
During the start of the COVID-19 lockdown, I ended up playing a lot of Fire Emblem Three Houses. 
After a couple of playthroughs I got tired of using the same "optimal" team of characters. 
Thus this project was born to randomly choose the characters that I would use.


This project was built with python and a couple of csv files. Essentially, the python program takes in a series of user input.
Based on the user's input, the program will read the correct csv file and randomly return the characters to use.


The only challenge I had with this project was learning python. At school, I have only been taught Java so this is the first programming language that I've learned on my own (if we don't count the usual HTML/CSS/javascript combinations).


As a result of this project, I've gotten my feet wet with some python and have made my Fire Emblem games more interesting.
Hopefully I can add a GUI interface to this project in a future development.
