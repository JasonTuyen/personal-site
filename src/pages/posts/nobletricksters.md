Here's what I learned from my online community and online clothing business. TL;DR at the end.


## Project Summary
Noble Tricksters was an online gaming community founded by my cousins and I in 2016. We did get togethers on Discord and I even edited videos for our YouTube channel.
After our community grew a bit, I decided to start a clothing brand based on our community.
The clothing brand no longer exists and our community isn't as active as before, but I thought I would write a post to reflect what I've learned from my Noble Tricksters community/business.


## Project Requirements
The original project came out of nowhere, we were just a couple of gamers that just slowly became a bigger community and eventually we decided to give ourselves a group name.
Because this wasn't really a planned project there weren't any specific goals and requirements that we were trying to meet.
If I had to choose one it would probably be to grow the community and make sure everyone was having fun.
This is also why I really enjoyed our online/offline get togethers, editing videos for the group, and eventually creating our clothing brand.


## Project Thoughts
The Noble Tricksters community were originally united through similar interests and we definitely wanted to become a community that creates things that will challenge the stereotypes and social stigmas that brought us together. Stigma such as gaming is unproductive and unpopular, these stigmas are now changing and it's pretty cool to see.
The things that we ended up creating to challenge these stigmas were videos and clothing to show that "hey this is fun and cool and we're an awesome community".


Anyways, the Noble Tricksters name was created by forming an oxymoron that reflected our personality. Sometimes we're serious and sometimes we're sarcastic but we're always ourselves. Hence our motto: "Serious. Sarcastic. Us." When the videos and clothing business came around we wanted to expand on this motto we came up with our mission/vision which is to make people feel comfortable being themselves and pursue what they love. In our case pursuing what we love was creating content that challenges stereotypes.


Creating videos for Noble Tricksters was pretty straightforward. We just got together to play games and then I would edit out the interesting parts and put things together.

As a result I learned how to use Sony Vegas and Adobe Premiere Pro, and I even [recently put these skills to use in a School Club Project](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU8LhZGkKsmXddsQjARLmsA)
***So learning new skills is not only fun but also a good way to enter new opportunities.***


With the clothing brand it required a little more work than video creation. The major issue was money, to start a clothing brand requires money to buy the shirts. 
Being a college student it was hard to throw a few hundred into this project.
But I took the risk because it was a project that I believed in.
At the start I was afraid to fail since I put in so much money and effort. 
In the end, I wish I could say this clothing business was successful but it wasn't and I didn't even break even in revenue.
This was probably my first time failing or at least my first time failing so hard with so much resources wasted.
***But I was still okay and I don't really see failure as a bad thing anymore.***


After getting funding the next steps are to find suppliers and market the product.
Finding suppliers required me to search for the best deals for clothing at my budget. 
I also needed to find a designer that can match our vision. 
I actually ended up finding the right suppliers/designers by asking friends for suggestions.
***Communication skills, networking, and not being afraid to ask for help is how I got through this step.***


The next step was sharing/marketing my products. I created a website using Wordpress and Elementor that I can lead people to see and buy our clothes. 
Unfortunately, I no longer have the code or a screenshot of the original Noble Tricksters Website.
***Which leads me to this piece of wisdom: keep good documentation!***

However, I did make a quick mockup on Figma. It's based on the few things that I did make notes of and what I remember the website used to look like.
I noted down the HEX code colors originally used (purple, gold, and gray) and the two fonts (Oswald and Roboto). I also recalled that our homepage had our logo next to a call-to-action button that led to our shop page. The remainder of the homepage had 2 major sections: an Instagram posts widget and a section dedicated to things our members made (such as art, music, videos, etc). Aside from the homepage and shop page, we also had the about page and contact page with every page fulfilling their obvious purpose.

## TL;DR
Because of challenges and failures, I learned that:
* In my opinion Sony Vegas is easier than Premiere Pro but the latter is more popular. 
* Always stay learning because it can lead to opportunities.
* Failure isn't the end of the world.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help.
* Work on communication and networking skills. 
* Wordpress and Elementor can help you get a website up and running quickly.
* Get into the habit of documenting (this is why I decided to make project/blog posts)
