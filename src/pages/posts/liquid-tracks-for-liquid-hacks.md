## Project Summary
This was a web application that I created during Liquid Hacks (a hackathon hosted by the esports Organization: Team Liquid) to promote mental health. This web application tracks water intake, sends reminders, provides inspirational League of Legends Quotes, and plays Animal Crossing music.


## Project Requirements
* Health and wellness themed (preferably relating to Team Liquid or eSports)
* Helps keep a user's well being in check


## Project Thoughts
This project was fun, especially because I made it during a hackathon.
This was my first hackathon and I definitely recommend that people attend a hackathon if possible.
You get to meet like minded people and can challenge yourself to build a project within a short time frame.
There's also the opportunity to connect with future employers and learn from workshop panels.
Unfortunately I didn't win the hackathon, but I did win the rapping mini-event.


The project is essentially a web app that tracks water intake with a few other added goodies such as: reminders, inspirational League of Legends quotes, and Animal Crossing background music.
It was built with html, css, and javascript. 
I had used these technologies before, but it's been a while since I've used them in a project.
Luckily there was a workshop panel hosted by Hack Club which served as a nice refresher for my html and css.


The main challenges that I had to deal with was re-learning javascript and learning how to use API calls. 
A specific issue that I ran into was web browsers not auto playing music.
I was never able to find a solution to that issue, but let me tell you that it was a night filled with Googling and milk tea.


As a result of this project, I learned how to use an API with javascript. 
This was my first time using an API and first time attending a hackathon so I would say this was a successful project.


Hopefully in the future I can turn this into a Google Chrome extension and maybe have the music auto play to a specific hour like in the Animal Crossing games.
