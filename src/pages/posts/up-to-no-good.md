The documentary of a 5th year super senior who's Up To No Good.


## Project Summary
Up To No Good is a daily reminder that I am still young and that I should enjoy myself. I think I speak for a majority of 20-somthings when I say: growing up is confusing. And that's okay because we don't have to rush to get our lives together. We should just enjoy ourselves and get up to no good.
