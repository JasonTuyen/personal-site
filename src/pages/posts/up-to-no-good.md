The documentary of a 5th year super senior who's Up To No Good.


## Project Summary
Online school means that students can study and travel at the same time.
So for my final school year, let's travel and learn together (we're going all around California, Oregon, Washington, New York, Tokyo-Japan, and Seoul-South Korea).
