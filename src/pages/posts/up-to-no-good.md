The documentary of a 5th year super senior who's Up To No Good.


## Project Summary
Up To No Good is a documentary for all the 20 somethings who are feeling overwhelmed about their futures. Growing up is confusing and it's totally okay for us to feel lost. We don't have to rush to get our lives together. We should just enjoy ourselves or as society likes to put it: get up to no good.

The name Up To No Good is based on a Cantonese saying "gaau gaau zan" which loosely translates to "up to no good".
