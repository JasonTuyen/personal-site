A reflection of my time participating in my school's Leadership Program. **TL;DR at the end.**


## Project Summary
The Hornet Leadership Program is an opportunity provided by my university for STEM students. The purpose of the Hornet Leadership Program is to develop students with importnat leadership skills and to connect students with members of the STEM community in the greater Sacramento region. 


## Project Requiremnets
* Attend seminars
* Make meaningful connections with classmates and guest speakers


## Project Thoughts
The outcome of this project is to gain in-demand skills that employers want by completing the 15-week course. Overall the course was enjoyable, inspirational, and educational. The course was structured in a way where we would learn a different topic/skill every week, with guest speakers sprinkled throughout the course. 


The most impactful part of the course was the self-assessment that we did before and after the course. The assessments allowed us to reflect and see our improvement over the course of the 15 weeks. Below you can see how I thought I improved and what my key takeaways for each week were.

## TL;DR
This 15-week course helped me develop important skill. The self-assessments given during course helped me practice self-reflection, which made it easy for me to visualize my improvements. Additionally, before taking this course I was on the fence about going to study abroad, but some topics and guest speakers inspired me to fully commit.
