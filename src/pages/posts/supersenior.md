The Documentary of a 5th Year Super Senior (final name and sponsor TBD)


## Project Summary
Online school has given students the opportunity to study and travel at the same time (following CDC Guidelines of course).
For my 2021-2022 School Year, join me as we learn and travel together through California, Canada, Japan, and South Korea.
