A random team generator for Fire Emblem Three Houses.


[GitHub Repo Link](https://github.com/JasonTuyen/RandomFE3H)


## Project Summary
A random team generator for the game, Fire Emblem Three Houses. 
Built using Python (and potentially tkinter for the GUI).
Running this program will return you a team for your next playthrough of Fire Emblem Three Houses. 


## Project Requirements
* Randomly generates characters and classes for a Fire Emblem Three Houses playthrough
* Should accept user input for type of playthrough


## Project Thoughts
This project was a quick summer project. 
During the start of the COVID-19 lockdown, I ended up playing a lot of Fire Emblem Three Houses to pass the time. 
After a couple of playthroughs I got tired of using the same "optimal" team of characters. 
So I created this program to make the game more interesting and to also practice my Python.


This project was built with python and a couple of csv files. Essentially, the python program takes in a series of user input.
Based on the user's input, the program will read the correct csv file and randomly return the characters to use.


The only challenge I had with this project was learning python. At school, I have only been taught Java so this is the first programming language that I've learned on my own.
As a result of this project, I've gotten my feet wet with some python and have made my Fire Emblem games more interesting.
Hopefully I can add a GUI interface to this project in a future development.
