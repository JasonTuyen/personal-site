        <p>RandomFE3H is a random team run generator for the game: Fire Emblem Three Houses (FE3H). Running this program will return you a team for your next playthough of FE3H. I created this program because I was getting bored of running "optimal" playthroughs of FE3H and to practice Python.</p>

        <p>LiquidTrackForLiquidHacks was a web application that I created during Liquid Hacks (a hackathon hosted by renowned esports organization Team Liquid) to promote mental health. This web application tracks water intake, sends reminders, provides inspirational League of Legends quotes, and plays hourly Animal Crossing music.</p>
